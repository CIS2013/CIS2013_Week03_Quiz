# Print 99 Bottles

Using while loops and if statements, print the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer".
Name the project `CIS2013_Week03_Quiz` and upload to your github account.

When done, it should looks something like this: 


    99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
    Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

    98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
    Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

    97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
    Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.

    etc....

    No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. 
    Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
